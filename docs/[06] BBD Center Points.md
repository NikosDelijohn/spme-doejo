## Information about BBD `Center Points`

In Design of Experiments, center points are specific experimental runs where all factors are set at their midpoint (central) levels between the high and low settings. Center points are fundamental for detecting curvature in the response surface and for providing an unbiased estimate of experimental error.

Center points serve two primary purposes:

- Curvature Detection: They reveal if the response changes nonlinearly with the factors.
- Error Estimation: Multiple center points improve precision in estimating pure error, especially when the underlying model is complex.

Deciding how many replicates to include at the center depends on the complexity and variability of the system:

1. Statistical Power: More replicates increase the power to detect statistically significant curvature.
2. Confidence Intervals: More observations allow for tighter confidence intervals around effect estimates.
